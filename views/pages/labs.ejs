            depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. Before RWD, everything was only fix and nice only in a specific screen resolution. However, when we change the screen size, all the element will look like a mess.
            For example, picture keep the same resolution on every resolution so they are too big on a small screen size. Moreover, text on the screen will be displayed but in a too small size.
          </p>
          <p><span class="ui header small green">Media queries:</span> help you to create different styles for different screen size so it helps you so much on creating RWD.

          <p><span class="ui header small green">1 "em":</span> is equal to the current font size so your margin which is defined by "em" would be follow the font size.
